# freeCodeCamp_productlandingpage

Creating a product landing page is the third of five responsive web challenges provided by freecodecamp.org. Here is a link to the challenge: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

The focus of the challenge was to develop a landing page that shows the key features, a demo video, and pricing options for a fictional product. The challenge needed to pass 16 tests, which can be viewed in Codepen: https://codepen.io/ryanfreeland/full/WNwWwoQ

My challenge passed all 16 tests and is compatible across Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers.

I built a bicycle product page, as I recently started cycling and I found a quick-and-easy product page would be beneficial for the new bike shopper.
